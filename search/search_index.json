Project Definition CivicTechJobs will be a website to find open volunteer positions for projects at hackforla. Introduction To The Project What is Civictechjobs.org? CivicTechJobs will be a platform to help prospective volunteers find interdisciplinary projects that will be useful for their career development while contributing to positive civic impact, and also a CMS (Content Mgmt System) for Hack for LA projects to be able to list their open roles. Why do it? To match the right volunteers with the right projects at hackforla. Hasn't it been done already? Yes, through CoP github pages. However, the process is cumbersome and involves multiple steps to match the candidate with the right role. Read more about what lead up to us developing this project, at our History page. So how is this different? We would like to streamline the process so that Product Managers can post the open oppotunities within their team efficiently, but most importantly a volunteer is able to find the right match with a project based on their skills, and aspirations. Guiding Objectives What are our guiding objectives? Provide product managers ability to post, edit, or close open positions on an easy to use instinctive website (CMS) Assist potential volunteers to self-filter for roles that matches their availability Provide potential volunteers list of open roles with different projects that matches their skills, and interest.

[2] Contra quos omnis dicendum breviter existimo. Quamquam philosophiae quidem vituperatoribus satis responsum est eo libro, quo a nobis philosophia defensa et collaudata est, cum esset accusata et vituperata ab Hortensio. qui liber cum et tibi probatus videretur et iis, quos ego posse iudicare arbitrarer, plura suscepi veritus ne movere hominum studia viderer, retinere non posse. Qui autem, si maxime hoc placeat, moderatius tamen id volunt fieri, difficilem quandam temperantiam postulant in eo, quod semel admissum coerceri reprimique non potest, ut propemodum iustioribus utamur illis, qui omnino avocent a philosophia, quam his, qui rebus infinitis modum constituant in reque eo meliore, quo maior sit, mediocritatem desiderent. [3] Sive enim ad sapientiam perveniri potest, non paranda nobis solum ea, sed fruenda etiam [sapientia] est; sive hoc difficile est, tamen nec modus est ullus investigandi veri, nisi inveneris, et quaerendi defatigatio turpis est, cum id, quod quaeritur, sit pulcherrimum. etenim si delectamur, cum scribimus, quis est tam invidus, qui ab eo nos abducat? sin laboramus, quis est, qui alienae modum statuat industriae? nam ut Terentianus Chremes non inhumanus, qui novum vicinum non vult 'fodere aut arare aut aliquid ferre denique' -- non enim illum ab industria, sed ab inliberali labore deterret --, sic isti curiosi, quos offendit noster minime nobis iniucundus labor. [4] Iis igitur est difficilius satis facere, qui se Latina scripta dicunt contemnere. in quibus hoc primum est in quo admirer, cur in gravissimis rebus non delectet eos sermo patrius, cum idem fabellas Latinas ad verbum e Graecis expressas non inviti legant. quis enim tam inimicus paene nomini Romano est, qui Ennii Medeam aut Antiopam Pacuvii spernat aut reiciat, quod se isdem Euripidis fabulis delectari dicat, Latinas litteras oderit? Synephebos ego, inquit, potius Caecilii aut Andriam Terentii quam utramque Menandri legam? [5] A quibus tantum dissentio, ut, cum Sophocles vel optime scripserit Electram, tamen male conversam Atilii mihi legendam putem, de quo Lucilius: 'ferreum scriptorem', verum, opinor, scriptorem tamen, ut legendus sit. rudem enim esse omnino in nostris poetis aut inertissimae segnitiae est aut fastidii delicatissimi. mihi quidem nulli satis eruditi videntur, quibus nostra ignota sunt. an 'Utinam ne in nemore . . .' nihilo minus legimus quam hoc idem Graecum, quae autem de bene beateque vivendo a Platone disputata sunt, haec explicari non placebit Latine? [6] Quid? si nos non interpretum fungimur munere, sed tuemur ea, quae dicta sunt ab iis quos probamus, eisque nostrum iudicium et nostrum scribendi ordinem adiungimus, quid habent, cur Graeca anteponant iis, quae et splendide dicta sint neque sint conversa de Graecis? nam si dicent ab illis has res esse tractatas, ne ipsos quidem Graecos est cur tam multos legant, quam legendi sunt. quid enim est a Chrysippo praetermissum in Stoicis? legimus tamen Diogenem, Antipatrum, Mnesarchum, Panaetium, multos alios in primisque familiarem nostrum Posidonium. quid? Theophrastus mediocriterne delectat, cum tractat locos ab Aristotele ante tractatos? quid? Epicurei num desistunt de isdem, de quibus et ab Epicuro scriptum est et ab antiquis, ad arbitrium suum scribere? quodsi Graeci leguntur a Graecis isdem de rebus alia ratione compositis, quid est, cur nostri a nostris non legantur? [7] Quamquam, si plane sic verterem Platonem aut Aristotelem, ut verterunt nostri poetae fabulas, male, credo, mererer de meis civibus, si ad eorum cognitionem divina illa ingenia transferrem. sed id neque feci adhuc nec mihi tamen, ne faciam, interdictum puto. locos quidem quosdam, si videbitur, transferam, et maxime ab iis, quos modo nominavi, cum inciderit, ut id apte fieri possit, ut ab Homero Ennius, Afranius a Menandro solet. Nec vero, ut noster Lucilius, recusabo, quo minus omnes mea legant. utinam esset ille Persius, Scipio vero et Rutilius multo etiam magis, quorum ille iudicium reformidans Tarentinis ait se et Consentinis et Siculis scribere. facete is quidem, sicut alia; sed neque tam docti tum erant, ad quorum iudicium elaboraret, et sunt illius scripta leviora, ut urbanitas summa appareat, doctrina mediocris. [8] Ego autem quem timeam lectorem, cum ad te ne Graecis quidem cedentem in philosophia audeam scribere? quamquam a te ipso id quidem facio provocatus gratissimo mihi libro, quem ad me de virtute misisti. Sed ex eo credo quibusdam usu venire; ut abhorreant a Latinis, quod inciderint in inculta quaedam et horrida, de malis Graecis Latine scripta deterius. quibus ego assentior, dum modo de isdem rebus ne Graecos quidem legendos putent. res vero bonas verbis electis graviter ornateque dictas quis non legat? nisi qui se plane Graecum dici velit, ut a Scaevola est praetore salutatus Athenis Albucius. [9] Quem quidem locum comit multa venustate et omni sale idem Lucilius, apud quem praeclare Scaevola: Graecum te, Albuci, quam Romanum atque Sabinum, municipem Ponti, Tritani, centurionum, praeclarorum hominum ac primorum signiferumque, maluisti dici. Graece ergo praetor Athenis, id quod maluisti, te, cum ad me accedis, saluto: 'chaere,' inquam, 'Tite!' lictores, turma omnis chorusque: 'chaere, Tite!' hinc hostis mi Albucius, hinc inimicus. [10] Sed iure Mucius. ego autem mirari [satis] non queo unde hoc sit tam insolens domesticarum rerum fastidium. non est omnino hic docendi locus; sed ita sentio et saepe disserui, Latinam linguam non modo non inopem, ut vulgo putarent, sed locupletiorem etiam esse quam Graecam. quando enim nobis, vel dicam aut oratoribus bonis aut poetis, postea quidem quam fuit quem imitarentur, ullus orationis vel copiosae vel elegantis ornatus defuit? Ego vero, quoniam forensibus operis, laboribus, periculis non deseruisse mihi videor praesidium, in quo a populo Romano locatus sum, debeo profecto, quantumcumque possum, in eo quoque elaborare, ut sint opera, studio, labore meo doctiores cives mei, nec cum istis tantopere pugnare, qui Graeca legere malint, modo legant illa ipsa, ne simulent, et iis servire, qui vel utrisque litteris uti velint vel, si suas habent, illas non magnopere desiderent. [11] Qui autem alia malunt scribi a nobis, aequi esse debent, quod et scripta multa sunt, sic ut plura nemini e nostris, et scribentur fortasse plura, si vita suppetet; et tamen, qui diligenter haec, quae de philosophia litteris mandamus, legere assueverit, iudicabit nulla ad legendum his esse potiora. quid est enim in vita tantopere quaerendum quam cum omnia in philosophia, tum id, quod his libris quaeritur, qui sit finis, quid extremum, quid ultimum, quo sint omnia bene vivendi recteque faciendi consilia referenda, quid sequatur natura ut summum ex rebus expetendis, quid fugiat ut extremum malorum? qua de re cum sit inter doctissimos summa dissensio, quis alienum putet eius esse dignitatis, quam mihi quisque tribuat, quid in omni munere vitae optimum et verissimum sit, exquirere? [12] An, partus ancillae sitne in fructu habendus, disseretur inter principes civitatis, P. Scaevolam Maniumque Manilium, ab iisque M. Brutus dissentiet -- quod et acutum genus est et ad usus civium non inutile, nosque ea scripta reliquaque eiusdem generis et legimus libenter et legemus -- haec, quae vitam omnem continent, neglegentur? nam, ut sint illa vendibiliora, haec uberiora certe sunt. quamquam id quidem licebit iis existimare, qui legerint. nos autem hanc omnem quaestionem de finibus bonorum et malorum fere a nobis explicatam esse his litteris arbitramur, in quibus, quantum potuimus, non modo quid nobis probaretur, sed etiam quid a singulis philosophiae disciplinis diceretur, persecuti sumus. [13] Ut autem a facillimis ordiamur, prima veniat in medium Epicuri ratio, quae plerisque notissima est. quam a nobis sic intelleges eitam, ut ab ipsis, qui eam disciplinam probant, non soleat accuratius explicari; verum enim invenire volumus, non tamquam adversarium aliquem convincere. accurate autem quondam a L. Torquato, homine omni doctrina erudito, defensa est Epicuri sententia de voluptate, a meque ei responsum, cum C. Triarius, in primis gravis et doctus adolescens, ei disputationi interesset. [14] Nam cum ad me in Cumanum salutandi causa uterque venisset, pauca primo inter nos de litteris, quarum summum erat in utroque studium, deinde Torquatus: Quoniam nacti te, inquit, sumus aliquando otiosum, certe audiam, quid sit, quod Epicurum nostrum non tu quidem oderis, ut fere faciunt, qui ab eo dissentiunt, sed certe non probes, eum quem ego arbitror unum vidisse verum maximisque erroribus animos hominum liberavisse et omnia tradidisse, quae pertinerent ad bene beateque vivendum. sed existimo te, sicut nostrum Triarium, minus ab eo delectari, quod ista Platonis, Aristoteli, Theophrasti orationis ornamenta neglexerit. nam illud quidem adduci vix possum, ut ea, quae senserit ille, tibi non vera videantur. [15] Vide, quantum, inquam, fallare, Torquate. oratio me istius philosophi non offendit; nam et complectitur verbis, quod vult, et dicit plane, quod intellegam; et tamen ego a philosopho, si afferat eloquentiam, non asperner, si non habeat, non admodum flagitem. re mihi non aeque satisfacit, et quidem locis pluribus. sed quot homines, tot sententiae; falli igitur possumus. Quam ob rem tandem, inquit, non satisfacit? te enim iudicem aequum puto, modo quae dicat ille bene noris. [16] Nisi mihi Phaedrum, inquam, tu mentitum aut Zenonem putas, quorum utrumque audivi, cum mihi nihil sane praeter sedulitatem probarent, omnes mihi Epicuri sententiae satis notae sunt. atque eos, quos nominavi, cum Attico nostro frequenter audivi, cum miraretur ille quidem utrumque, Phaedrum autem etiam amaret, cotidieque inter nos ea, quae audiebamus, conferebamus, neque erat umquam controversia, quid ego intellegerem, sed quid probarem. [17] Quid igitur est? inquit; audire enim cupio, quid non probes. Principio, inquam, in physicis, quibus maxime gloriatur, primum totus est alienus. Democritea dicit perpauca mutans, sed ita, ut ea, quae corrigere vult, mihi quidem depravare videatur. ille atomos quas appellat, id est corpora individua propter soliditatem, censet in infinito inani, in quo nihil nec summum nec infimum nec medium nec ultimum nec extremum sit, ita ferri, ut concursionibus inter se cohaerescant, ex quo efficiantur ea, quae sint quaeque cernantur, omnia, eumque motum atomorum nullo a principio, sed ex aeterno tempore intellegi convenire. [18] Epicurus autem, in quibus sequitur Democritum, non fere labitur. quamquam utriusque cum multa non probo, tum illud in primis, quod, cum in rerum natura duo quaerenda sint, unum, quae materia sit, ex qua quaeque res efficiatur, alterum, quae vis sit, quae quidque efficiat, de materia disseruerunt, vim et causam efficiendi reliquerunt. sed hoc commune vitium, illae Epicuri propriae ruinae: censet enim eadem illa individua et solida corpora ferri deorsum suo pondere ad lineam, hunc naturalem esse omnium corporum motum. [19] Deinde ibidem homo acutus, cum illud ocurreret, si omnia deorsus e regione ferrentur et, ut dixi, ad lineam, numquam fore ut atomus altera alteram posset attingere itaque ** attulit rem commenticiam: declinare dixit atomum perpaulum, quo nihil posset fieri minus; ita effici complexiones et copulationes et adhaesiones atomorum inter se, ex quo efficeretur mundus omnesque partes mundi, quaeque in eo essent. Quae cum tota res (est) ficta pueriliter, tum ne efficit [quidem], quod vult. nam et ipsa declinatio ad libidinem fingitur -- ait enim declinare atomum sine causa; quo nihil turpius physico, quam fieri quicquam sine causa dicere, -- et illum motum naturalem omnium ponderum, ut ipse constituit, e regione inferiorem locum petentium sine causa eripuit atomis nec tamen id, cuius causa haec finxerat, assecutus est. [20] Nam si omnes atomi declinabunt, nullae umquam cohaerescent, sive aliae declinabunt, aliae suo nutu recte ferentur, primum erit hoc quasi, provincias atomis dare, quae recte, quae oblique ferantur, deinde eadem illa atomorum, in quo etiam Democritus haeret, turbulenta concursio hunc mundi ornatum efficere non poterit. ne illud quidem physici, credere aliquid esse minimum, quod profecto numquam putavisset, si a Polyaeno, familiari suo, geometrica discere maluisset quam illum etiam ipsum dedocere. Sol Democrito magnus videtur, quippe homini erudito in geometriaque perfecto, huic pedalis fortasse; tantum enim esse censet, quantus videtur, vel paulo aut maiorem aut minorem. [21] Ita, quae mutat, ea corrumpit, quae sequitur sunt tota Democriti, atomi, inane, imagines, quae eidola nominant, quorum incursione non solum videamus, sed etiam cogitemus; infinitio ipsa, quam apeirian vocant, tota ab illo est, tum innumerabiles mundi, qui et oriantur et intereant cotidie. Quae etsi mihi nullo modo probantur, tamen Democritum laudatum a ceteris ab hoc, qui eum unum secutus esset, nollem vituperatum. [22] Iam in altera philosophiae parte. quae est quaerendi ac disserendi, quae logikh dicitur, iste vester plane, ut mihi quidem videtur, inermis ac nudus est. tollit definitiones, nihil de dividendo ac partiendo docet, non quo modo efficiatur concludaturque ratio tradit, non qua via captiosa solvantur ambigua distinguantur ostendit; iudicia rerum in sensibus ponit, quibus si semel aliquid falsi pro vero probatum sit, sublatum esse omne iudicium veri et falsi putat. [23] Confirmat autem illud vel maxime, quod ipsa natura, ut ait ille, sciscat et probet, id est voluptatem et dolorem. ad haec et quae sequamur et quae fugiamus refert omnia. quod quamquam Aristippi est a Cyrenaicisque melius liberiusque defenditur, tamen eius modi esse iudico, ut nihil homine videatur indignius. ad maiora enim quaedam nos natura genuit et conformavit, ut mihi quidem videtur. ac fieri potest, ut errem, sed ita prorsus existimo, neque eum Torquatum, qui hoc primus cognomen invenerit, aut torquem illum hosti detraxisse, ut aliquam ex eo perciperet corpore voluptatem, aut cum Latinis tertio consulatu conflixisse apud Veserim propter voluptatem; quod vero securi percussit filium, privavisse se etiam videtur multis voluptatibus, cum ipsi naturae patrioque amori praetulerit ius maiestatis atque imperii.","title":"About"},{"location":"resources/","text":"Resources More resources to be added as project progresses: GoFullPage Screenshot Chrome Extension ' Userflow Diagram Research Slide Deck Our Figma Task and User Flow Our Shared Google Drive For Developers Contributing.md Frontend Architecture Backend Architecture GitHub Architecture Installation Instructions Development Culture","title":"Resources"},{"location":"resources/#resources","text":"More resources to be added as project progresses: GoFullPage Screenshot Chrome Extension ' Userflow Diagram Research Slide Deck Our Figma Task and User Flow Our Shared Google Drive","title":"Resources"},{"location":"resources/#for-developers","text":"Contributing.md Frontend Architecture Backend Architecture GitHub Architecture Installation Instructions Development Culture","title":"For Developers"},{"location":"developer/backend/","text":"Backend Architecture \u251c\u2500\u2500 .github/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 app/ # Backend \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 config/ # Backend \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 settings.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 frontend/ # Backend \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 server/ # Backend \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 .babelrc \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 manage.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt # Backend \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 package.json \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 package-lock.json \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 webpack.config.js \u251c\u2500\u2500 dev/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 django.dockerfile \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 webpack.dockerfile \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 dev.env \u251c\u2500\u2500 .dockerignore \u251c\u2500\u2500 .gitignore \u251c\u2500\u2500 jsconfig.json \u251c\u2500\u2500 CONTRIBUTING.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 docker-compose.yml \u251c\u2500\u2500 LICENSE \u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md Overall project structure \u251c\u2500\u2500 config/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 <Django Project Files> \u251c\u2500\u2500 frontend/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 <Django App Files> \u251c\u2500\u2500 server/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 <Django App Files> \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 <RESTFramework Files> \u251c\u2500\u2500 manage.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt Backend Architecture Summary Backend Tech Stack : Django, DjangoRESTFramework The backend architecture is consists the docker/ directory, the Django config/ project, the frontend/ and server/ Django apps, and a couple of Django or Docker-related loose files.

Inside is not only an overview of our components, but also usage tips, and strategies to translate Figma designs into components for flexible, dynamic webpages. Concepts To understand our Design System, these are some overarching concepts to keep in mind when working with the DS. Implementing from Figma to Frontend Development UI designers specialize in turning project requirements into graphical interfaces that fits project requirements. Designers, however, are not coders. As a result, here are some development-related aspects of componentization that designers do not consider: the way components change as screen size changes the ease of replicating components in code the proper way to configure svg assets for development Because of these factors, the way a prototype is built on Figma does not necessarily translate 1:1 to how the designs should be build as code. For example, Figma designs does not use SCSS mixins to simplify code or percentages as units of size. Likewise, we must contend with the fact that Figma designs are static screens tied to very specific viewport sizes. As developers we need to recreate the Figma designs while also considering the intent behind a design. As a developer, we need to effectively communicate with designers at multiple stage of the Figma design process. This means providing recommendations or alternatives that are simpler and easier for the developer to implement and maintain. At CivicTechJobs, designers use two standard viewport widths when creating our UIs: 1440px for desktop and 375px for mobile. The appearance of the UI beyond these two sizes are determined by us, as developers, as we componentize the Figma designs. Do note though that the smallest, popular, mobile screen width is 320px, which is the miminum when designing the UI. Scalable and Responsive Components When creating or using components, it is good to keep in mind the differences between a scalable component and responsive component. A scalable component: takes up a certain fraction of the total screen size shrinks and grows along with screen size uses relative css sizing units, such as % or vm These columns show scalable behavior. The columns smoothly shrink and grow with the screen size. A responsive component: takes up an absolute amount of the screen remains static until reaching a certain breakpoint uses static css sizing units, such as px These buttons show responsive behavior. The buttons do not change until the screen reaches a certain breakpoint. Scalability and responsiveness are not mutually exclusive. A webpage can contain both scalable and responsive components. As a matter of fact, a single component can be both responsive and scalable. This card shows both scalable and responsive behavior. The width smoothly change with the screen size, but drastically changes at our max small tablet breakpoint. Only by combining both scalability and responsiveness in our design, can we create a high-quality website. When translating from Figma to code, most of the time, the work is in deciding what part of the Figma design should scale, and what part should be responsive. As a rule of thumb, when designing the transition from the desktop to mobile Figma, scale down empty space and margins, and responsively shrink buttons and text. PropType as Documentation As a small project, React recommends the use of PropTypes as our type checking library. By using PropTypes, we have an easy way to look up hints on how to use our components. Button.propTypes = { addClass: PropTypes.string, color: PropTypes.oneOf([\"primary\", \"primary-dark\"]), disabled: PropTypes.bool, href: PropTypes.string, length: PropTypes.oneOf([\"\", \"long\"]), onClick: PropTypes.func, size: PropTypes.oneOf([\"sm\", \"md\", \"lg\", \"icon\"]), target: PropTypes.oneOf([ \"_blank\", \"_self\", \"_parent\", \"_top\", PropTypes.string, ]), }; For this <Button> component, PropTypes provide clues on the component's props. From these hints, a developer can guess that a small, long button would be declared as <Button size=\"sm\" length=\"long\"> Because comprehensive documentation is difficult for a small team to maintain, we rely on PropTypes and cleanly written code to provide clues on how to use each component. We recommend new developers take time to play with the components in components/ to fully understand how to utilize them. Components While we can use pure CSS as our styling sheet, using SCSS with React components allows us to standardize our components in a powerful way. Componentization allows: quick customizations through React props standardizations to our components for accessibility reuse of the same component across multiple pages updating designs by simply editing the base component Because of these benefits, we use a component-first approach to developing web pages. Please componentize as much as possible and use them to build high-quality web pages! As a note, the DS is put together based on industry trends and practices. If you have ever explored Bootstrap, MUI, or Atlassian Design System, you will see many similarities between their components and ours. Mixins and Classes \"Use classes in HTML but mixins in SCSS.\" Most of our styles have a class and mixin equivalent. The class, for the most part, is created from just declaring the mixin inside the class. @mixin hidden { display: none; } .hidden { @include hidden; } Above is the hidden mixin definition. Below is the hidden mixin declaration as part of the .hidden class. These are both provided to suit different use cases. For example, the class version is best suited for declaring inside of React components or HTML elements as part of the addClass prop or className attribute. On the other hand, the mixin version is best used when adding it to your own custom style, such as with media queries. .my-own-custom-class { @include breakpoint-media-max(\"smtablet\") { @include hidden; // Do this @extend .hidden; // Do not do this, will break @include col-size(6); // Do this @extend .col-6; // Do not do this, will break } } Please use the mixin version when you want your own custom style to inherit from an existing style! Layout and Columns \"Using layout and column utilities automatically adds scalability to your pages.\" As with most design systems, we use a standard 12-column system to subdivide our layouts. Each column, without spacing, is worth *8.33% of its container's width**. This means that columns are, by default, scalable. To use of our column classes, first declare a parent container with the .flex-container class. Then use col-* classes in each children, replacing the * with the number for the column size. We need to use a parent .flex-container with col-* classes to subdivide the UI. Our 12-column system can be used in conjunction with .row and nested .col-* to further subdivide the UI, and create more complex layouts. With .flex-container , .row , and .col-* , we can create complex layouts that fit our purposes. *Note: Although Figma uses 12 columns to subdivide the entire screen, our column classes subdivides the container . This means that we can divide the whole screen into columns, and then divide each column even further to achieve our desired ratios. Smart Spacing \"99% of the time, you'll want to reclaim space from padding, margins, or empty space as screen size shrinks.\" The spacing utilities are classified by attributes and size. Table of Spacing Attributes Spacing attribute (margins) Meaning | Spacing attribute (padding) Meaning m all margins | p all paddings mt margin-top | pt padding-top mr margin-right | pr padding-right mb margin-bottom | pb padding-bottom ml margin-left | pl padding-left mx margin-left and -right | px padding-left and -right my margin-top and -bottom | py padding-top and -bottom Table of Spacing Sizes Spacing size Actual size (px) 0 0px 1 8px 2 16px 3 24px 4 32px 5 40px Tables showing the different way we classifies our spacing utilities. As an example, .px-4 sets the left and right padding as 32px. Because our DS is based on a 12-column system, spacing utilities are made such that adding them on would not alter the 12-column system. For that reason, it is optimal to use the spacing utilities whenever possible over setting custom margins or padding. Add margins responsibly. Try to use the spacing utilities over creating custom margin classes. As an example, if Figma indicates a 10px left margin, use either .ml-1 or .ml-2 . Other times, however, Figma designs show spacing that falls outside of our size range. In this scenario, rather than set a specific margin, try to use centering instead, as large spaces are usually not a result of spacing, but of centering. By being smart about the way we include spacing, we ensure scalability and reduce the maintenance cost of our code. Responsive Mixins \"When using responsive mixins, order matters! Always declare them from big to small.\" Several of our components have *-responsive mixins at the end of the .scss file. These act as helpers to quickly create responsiveness into our components, keeping our code simple to understand. These mixins always use max-width in its media query (as we use a desktop-first approach), so order matters! To use them properly, specify a default* and declare screen size from largest to smallest: DO: specify a default on top and declare *-responsive mixins from large to small screen sizes. DON'T: declare *-responsive mixins without a default on top or from a smaller to larger screen size. *Note: There is one caveat to that as some components come with their own default. For example, buttons take a size prop, in which you declare a default already. Therefore when using the responsive mixin for button size, there is no need to declare a top level default in the scss code. SVGs as Components and as Data-URLs SVG assets are read into our codebase as React components or data-urls. As React components: specified with a starting uppercase allows the use of React props to dynamically alter the component requires editing stroke and fill values to inherit to allow passing in props requires a wrapper element to add additional styling are imported directly from the image file difficult to work with by provide lots of customization As Data-urls: specified with a starting lowercase are used as the src in img tags, to allow quick width/length adjustments difficult to dynamically change simple to declare and use are imported with ?url qualifiers not customizable beyond width and height // COP Icons import CopIconData from \"./svgs/cop-icon-datascience.svg\"; import CopIconEngineering from \"./svgs/cop-icon-engineering.svg\"; import CopIconOps from \"./svgs/cop-icon-ops.svg\"; import CopIconProduct from \"./svgs/cop-icon-product.svg\"; import CopIconUiux from \"./svgs/cop-icon-uiux.svg\"; import copIconData from \"./svgs/cop-icon-datascience.svg?url\"; import copIconEngineering from \"./svgs/cop-icon-engineering.svg?url\"; import copIconOps from \"./svgs/cop-icon-ops.svg?url\"; import copIconProduct from \"./svgs/cop-icon-product.svg?url\"; import copIconUiux from \"./svgs/cop-icon-uiux.svg?url\"; The top icons are imported from the image file as SVG components. The bottom icons are the same file imported as data-urls. Notice how the latter import file adds \"?url\". When using our SVG assets make sure to use the best import for the job. In some cases, however, neither of these imports are optimal to use. For example the SVG itself might be incorrectly formatted. This SVG contains extra spaces, especially on the bottom. This image is impossible to center correctly without adding unnecessary margins. In this case, rather than calculating some difficult to maintain, complex spacing, simply request the design team to provide a better SVG or edit the SVG yourself and send a copy to the design team. Troubleshooting Errors You may not @extend selectors across media queries. This happens when @extend is used inside of media queries. An example using our DS, .header-logo-desktop { @include breakpoint-media-max(\"smtablet\") { @extend .hidden; } } Using @extend inside of a media query will result in an error. Instead, use a mixin declaration with @include instead. Most classes in the DS include an equivalent mixin for this specific purpose. .header-logo-desktop { @include breakpoint-media-max(\"smtablet\") { @include hidden; } } This works because it declares a mixin rather than extend the class! To avoid these errors, it is encouraged to use the mixin rather than the class version of a specific style for inheritance whenever possible!

If you have any questions be sure to let us know! We strive to create an inclusive space for developers to learn and achieve their goals. Make Issues To make an issue, follow this guide from GitHub, or take a look at this section of the CONTRIBUTING.md. At CivicTechJobs, updating the project starts with creating an issue outlining the situation and changes needed to resolve the situation. When writing an issue, a good rule of thumb is to write as if another developer would be the one to work on the issue. Therefore, being thorough is better than brief. Some good guidelines to follow: Write a brief, two sentence summary for the overview. Be sure to note why these changes is needed. In the overview, use language with little jargon. Action items are usually step by step instructions or a list of requirements. Longer explanations or useful documentation, if needed, are placed in the Instruction/Resources section. Dependencies should 90% of the time be another issue. If this issue does not exist, it should probably be made and referenced as a dependency. Likewise, the dependency should reference the issue it is a dependency for so that there is a trail to release issues with dependencies. Check out examples of developer issues, such as this , for how to structure and word issues. After writing out the issue, be sure to add labels . At minimum, we need three labels, one each from the \"size\", \"role\" and \"feature/p-feature\" series. In most cases, you should not create your own label. If you are unsure what labels to place, it is okay to leave it be, as another team member will help you when they notice the issue lacks certain labels. Once an issue is created, and placed in the Project Management project board, the developer is mostly done with the issue. If the issue contains a dependency, it will move into the \"Ice Box\" column via GitHub automation , or \"New Issue Approval\", otherwise. On rare occasions, a project manager, or other team members, might ping you with questions on the issue. Perhaps the team member did not understand the jargon, or the instructions were unclear. In that case, read their concerns carefully and either answer with a comment, or edit the original issue. Eventually, the issue will be approved, prioritized, and released into the \"Prioritized Backlog\" column, where developers can work on it. Resolve Issues To resolve an issue, take a look at this section of the CONTRIBUTING.md. When choosing an issue to work on from the \"Prioritized Backlog\" column, it is good to note the \"role\" and \"size\" label. This signals the expertise required and time commitment needed to resolve the issue. As a rule of thumb, a smaller issue should take a week, and a larger issue, two or three weeks. This should give you a good idea on what issues is best for you to take at the moment. If you are completely new, we recommend taking smaller issues to understand your limits before pushing them further. That said, you are free to work on whatever you want. On occasion, when an issue is being worked on for an inordinate amount of time, the team might request an update on your progress. When giving your progress, it is courteous to give an ETA on the issue, and evaluate on your ability to resolve the issue in a reasonable timeframe. If an issue is taking far too long, it might be wise to abandon the issue and work on something that might bring more value to you and the team. Also, one final note: Do not contact the team via e-mail or Slack to review your pull request unless it as been 72 hours since it was opened! The team will occasionally comb for pull requests and review them. If you want to move on to another issue, consider reviewing another developer's pull request (if you are part of the team), contribute to other open source projects, or ask the team for additional tasks. Most issues can be divided into two broad types: frontend issues, and backend issues. Frontend issues Usually involves the appearance of the website Usually easier than backend issues Requires little research Is occasionally an audit May involve documentation When working on frontend issues, there will usually be a link to the Figma design. Figma often contains multiple prototypes and future prototypes. When looking for our current design, go to the bottom right corner and look for a pink rectangle. Anything within that represents our most up-to-date design. Use that as a reference for your frontend issues. If the pink rectangle is not there, please request the UI design team to put a pink rectangle on the latest approved design. On rare circumstances, designs can change in the middle of work. This is something that happens as part of development, but will often be telegraphed during meetings. If a design change, you are free to reassess and abandon your current issue, or code pragmatically to ensure your work would not need a massive overhaul. Backend issues Usually involves research and discussion Can also pertain to GitHub Actions Usually takes some time May involve documentation Review Code To review code, please take a look at this GitHub documentation , and this portion of our CONTRIBUTING.md . Code that should be reviewed is found in the pull request tab . These are issues that require someone to look over for several criteria: Applicability: Were the correct changes made? Where new lines added or removed that are extraneous to the issue? Brokenness: Did the changes break the website? Is the changes responsive to view-port changes? Cleanliness: Is the new code programmatic or messy? Would the code be hard to maintain in the long run? When code meets all three criteria, it can then be merged and made a part of the website. Otherwise, the review should indicate changes that needs to be made. As an advanced project, CivicTechJobs have certain expectations for our developers. One of these is that issues of size 1 or 2 is small enough that we \"pre-review\" them. This means that we are confident that the developer can resolve these issues without review. Therefore, these issues can be merged directly into our code-base upon resolution. That said, it is still fine to request the team to review your code if feedback is desired. Important: Although issues can be pre-reviewed, do not make a habit of merging without making a pull request. There will be times when you performed an accidental merge, which could be a pain to fix on the command line. As one final note, code can be merged solely on one approved review but it is fine to request more reviewers or ask for the team to review it during a developer meeting.","title":"Development Culture"},{"location":"developer/development-culture/#development-culture","text":"At CivicTechJobs, the developers of our team have 3 key tasks: Make issues Resolve issues Review code This guide will discuss how each of these work at CivicTechJobs. If you have any questions be sure to let us know! We strive to create an inclusive space for developers to learn and achieve their goals.","title":"Development Culture"},{"location":"developer/development-culture/#make-issues","text":"To make an issue, follow this guide from GitHub, or take a look at this section of the CONTRIBUTING.md. At CivicTechJobs, updating the project starts with creating an issue outlining the situation and changes needed to resolve the situation. When writing an issue, a good rule of thumb is to write as if another developer would be the one to work on the issue. Therefore, being thorough is better than brief. Some good guidelines to follow: Write a brief, two sentence summary for the overview. Be sure to note why these changes is needed. In the overview, use language with little jargon. Action items are usually step by step instructions or a list of requirements. Longer explanations or useful documentation, if needed, are placed in the Instruction/Resources section. Dependencies should 90% of the time be another issue. If this issue does not exist, it should probably be made and referenced as a dependency. Likewise, the dependency should reference the issue it is a dependency for so that there is a trail to release issues with dependencies. Check out examples of developer issues, such as this , for how to structure and word issues. After writing out the issue, be sure to add labels . At minimum, we need three labels, one each from the \"size\", \"role\" and \"feature/p-feature\" series. In most cases, you should not create your own label. If you are unsure what labels to place, it is okay to leave it be, as another team member will help you when they notice the issue lacks certain labels. Once an issue is created, and placed in the Project Management project board, the developer is mostly done with the issue. If the issue contains a dependency, it will move into the \"Ice Box\" column via GitHub automation , or \"New Issue Approval\", otherwise. On rare occasions, a project manager, or other team members, might ping you with questions on the issue. Perhaps the team member did not understand the jargon, or the instructions were unclear. In that case, read their concerns carefully and either answer with a comment, or edit the original issue. Eventually, the issue will be approved, prioritized, and released into the \"Prioritized Backlog\" column, where developers can work on it.","title":"Make Issues"},{"location":"developer/development-culture/#resolve-issues","text":"To resolve an issue, take a look at this section of the CONTRIBUTING.md. When choosing an issue to work on from the \"Prioritized Backlog\" column, it is good to note the \"role\" and \"size\" label. This signals the expertise required and time commitment needed to resolve the issue. As a rule of thumb, a smaller issue should take a week, and a larger issue, two or three weeks. This should give you a good idea on what issues is best for you to take at the moment. If you are completely new, we recommend taking smaller issues to understand your limits before pushing them further. That said, you are free to work on whatever you want. On occasion, when an issue is being worked on for an inordinate amount of time, the team might request an update on your progress. When giving your progress, it is courteous to give an ETA on the issue, and evaluate on your ability to resolve the issue in a reasonable timeframe. If an issue is taking far too long, it might be wise to abandon the issue and work on something that might bring more value to you and the team. Also, one final note: Do not contact the team via e-mail or Slack to review your pull request unless it as been 72 hours since it was opened! The team will occasionally comb for pull requests and review them. If you want to move on to another issue, consider reviewing another developer's pull request (if you are part of the team), contribute to other open source projects, or ask the team for additional tasks.

Anything within that represents our most up-to-date design. Use that as a reference for your frontend issues. If the pink rectangle is not there, please request the UI design team to put a pink rectangle on the latest approved design. On rare circumstances, designs can change in the middle of work.

Although the overall structure appears deceptively basic, it only represents a fraction of our devops files. Several of our files, such as the ones that construct our staging environment, contains sensitive information, and as such as not placed in our public repository. For most frontend and backend work, there is never a need to access these files. *Note: On the rare occasions that there is a need to access the sensitive files for environments other than development, please consult the development lead of the project. They will know exactly what files you need, and what permissions you need to access them. Overview of Directories and Files dev/: contains two dockerfiles and an env file. django.dockerfile contains information for our Django server setup. webpack.dockerfile contains information to start our webpack watch plugin. dev.env.example is an example of the env file needed to configure our dev environment. .dockerignore: This file tells Docker to ignore certain files when building the container. These are usually files that pertain to docker or git, which are not important when building the webserver. docker-compose.yml: Contains instructions for docker when we run \"docker compose\". To know more about what each line does, please consult Docker's documentation . Docker Docker is a platform that allows packaging and virtualizing applications within a container. This gives developers the powerful ability to collaborate in a stable, synchonized environment, and deploying web applications with the greatest of ease. We will not be going too much into Docker here, but we will explain in greater depth some of the Docker configurations we have made. docker-compose.yml This file contains configuration directions for docker compose. It consists of three services: pgdb (our database), webpack (our webpack bundler), and django (our django server). The webpack and django service relies in separate dockerfiles, located in the dev directory to build the container. This separation of dockerfiles enable each container to be build with its own set of dependencies. It also makes rebuilding the container simple when dependencies are migrated to a newer version. For those of you used to creating applications without Docker, most would run webpack and django in separate terminals, so that they can both run at the same time. For the purposes of brevity, the different services can be considered to be Docker's way of running separate terminals. One will also notice that the Django command uses a placeholder server name, 0.0.0.0:8000. This placeholder is important, since Docker creates an isolated environment. As a result, servers that are run in Docker does not recognize a browser from outside of that environment. Without this server name, localhost:8000 will not reach the server, as the server would recognize your browser as coming from a foreign machine. Therefore, all warnings related to 0.0.0.0, should they pop-up, should be ignored. *.dockerfile Dockerfiles are files that define how a container is built. Although containerization is a deep concept, to put it briefly, you can think of containers as separate \"mini-computers\", each programmed to do one thing. Some containers, such as our pgdb container does not require a dockerfile to configure it, as it works out of the box. On the otherhand, our webpack and django containers need dockerfile to built out the files we need to run it effectively. FROM node:latest WORKDIR /code # install app dependencies COPY ./package.json ./ COPY ./package-lock.json ./ RUN npm install # add app COPY . . Sample dockerfile that copies the package.json from a project and installs all dependencies. Dockerfiles are usually named as just dockerfile , as that is the default name that docker looks for when constructing our builds. Since our project requires multiple dockerfiles, we name them with .dockerfile extensions, a convention that allows VSCode to detect dockerfiles and use appropriate syntax highlighting. Do note that docker and dockerfiles can be fickle to work with, especially on old devices. Further down this documentation are various tips and commands that can be used with docker to help debug your code. But as always, consulting official documentation is the best way to get accurate, up-to-date information. Environments Development Our development environment is entirely defined by our docker-compose.yml , and the files inside of dev/ . More information about those files can be found above. Of note, however, is the dev.env.example file. This file is only a sample, but lists out all the environmental variables needed to run our website. While most of them are prefilled, some uses <> to indicate placeholders, which must be filled in by the developer. Staging More information on our staging files can be found with our staging files. To access this information, please ask for the required permissions from the development lead. Useful Commands docker compose down -v Useful to completely remove a container and related volumes. This is helpful when fiddling with database settings, which often breaks the database. This command allows the container to be restarted fresh. docker compose -f <filename> <docker command> Use this to specify an alternate docker-compose file to run your commands, such as docker-compose-other.yml. This is useful if you want to test out docker for yourself. docker compose run <container> <command> This is useful to run one time commands inside your container. Some good commands to run are: python manage.py makemigrations python manage.py migrate pip install -r requirements.txt npm install docker exec -it <container> sh Use this to do heavier debugging inside of your container. What this does is open the shell inside of the container's \"mini-computer\". This allows you to explore the files inside the container to see if it matches what you would expect after building is finished. This command only works when a container is running, so use docker compose run -d to run your container in the background beforehand. docker compose build --progress=plain Sometimes when a build is happening, the logs are too opaque to debug if a step goes wrong. This commands makes the logs a bit more verbose so that you might have an easier time debugging.

This directory is a Django app , which is a set of files that can be ported to any Django-based application. Since our frontend is a Django app, it takes advantage of the way Django serves its static assets. Every Django app, by default, looks to the templates/ * directory within the app for the html template file to serve. This template usually contains <script> and <style> tags denoting the location of CSS and JS files. In Django, these files are usually located inside the static/ * directory. Likewise, our frontend app store our templates and static assets within these directories. Despite these similiarties, however, the files in these two directories should never be manipulated by a developer. These files are automatically generated by an application called Webpack via configurations in webpack.config.js and .babelrc . The files that should be manipulated by developers are housed within the src/ directory. Inside of here are directories for assets/ , componenents/ , pages/ , and templates/ . Each of these directories contains the files which Webpack reads and then bundle into output files for the static/ and template/ directories. *Note: The templates/ and static/ directories contain within them a frontend/ directory in order to namespace template and static files. Although this serves little purpose for our project, it is a Django convention that prevents Django from confusing the templates/ and static/ directories from the frontend app vs another app. Overview of Directories and Files frontend/: houses all the frontend files. frontend/src/: houses all the files for developers to manipulate. The files here are read by Webpack before being bundled into the static/ and templates/ directories. assets/: this is where we store all of our miscellaneous files, such as .jpegs, .svgs, .gifs, etc. componenents/: this is where we store the files that generate our components, such as buttons and cards. To learn more about this in-depth, read the components section of this guide. pages/: contains the React files that pools together various components to generate a page. router/: contains the routing logic for the project.

As you might have guessed, git does not push empty directories. Why do we separate Babel from Webpack? If you have explored documentation from Webpack, you might learn that the babel-loader in module > rules can accept the settings noted in .babelrc . The reason why we separate these settings into another file is because Webpack is not, in theory, the only application that makes use of these settings. Although we have no other apps that makes use of .babelrc at the moment, this can change in the future. Therefore, this separation of files is a form of future proofing.

This directory is a Django app , which is a set of files that can be ported to any Django-based application. Since our frontend is a Django app, it takes advantage of the way Django serves its static assets. Every Django app, by default, looks to the templates/ * directory within the app for the html template file to serve. This template usually contains <script> and <style> tags denoting the location of CSS and JS files. In Django, these files are usually located inside the static/ * directory. Likewise, our frontend app store our templates and static assets within these directories. Despite these similiarties, however, the files in these two directories should never be manipulated by a developer. These files are automatically generated by an application called Webpack via configurations in webpack.config.js and .babelrc . The files that should be manipulated by developers are housed within the src/ directory. Inside of here are directories for assets/ , componenents/ , pages/ , and templates/ .

And make sure that the file is not hidden. 3. code ERR_SOCKET_TIMEOUT This can result for several reasons, such as havin your sockets overloaded. In order to prevent this, the best thing to do is to lower the amount of sockets used when performing npm install. Change this line in docker/webpack : RUN npm install to: RUN npm install --maxsockets=1 This should allow docker compose up to work. Be sure to delete the addition once your image and container is set up. 4. [dependency] not found This sometimes happen when npm did not install successfully.
